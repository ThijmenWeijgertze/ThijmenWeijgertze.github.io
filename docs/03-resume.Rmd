### Who am I

Hi I'm "Thijmen Weijgertze" a 20 year old student from Ede, Gelderland (2003). I tend to be very passionate about my study and love to talk about topics surrounding Life Sciences. As of writing this résumé I live with my parents, sister and our dog "Saartje" (breed: markiesje). In my free time my biggest hobby is music. I produce music from time to time and play piano almost daily. Besides music I also like to spent time with friends in the weekends and cycle so now and then.
