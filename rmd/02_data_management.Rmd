# Data management

I've a reorganized the folders of an older project using the principles of the Guerilla analytics framework. To illustrate the folder structure I've made a directory tree using the fs package.

```{r}
# Creating a directory tree
fs::dir_tree(path = here::here("data_management"))
```
