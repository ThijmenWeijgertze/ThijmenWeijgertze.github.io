# Main page

### Introduction

This github page is written by Thijmen Weijgertze using Rstudio. I am a 3rd year Life Science student at HU University of Applied Sciences Utrecht. In the past half year I've followed a DataScience minor provided by the HU. This Github page serves as my DataScience portofolio for showing off my DataScience skills. The course is created by @amdhaanTlscdsfb26v20Workflows2021 based on the "bookdown: Authoring Books and Technical Documents with R Markdown" book from @xieBookdownAuthoringBooks.
